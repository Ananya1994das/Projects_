Collecting customer feedback can provide insights to reduce cancellation rates. The drop in bookings compared to the previous year highlights the need for targeted strategies, especially during peak months (May-August). Offering attractive packages for long stays, discounts for low-booking countries, and domain-specific offers for underperforming market segments can help increase bookings. Collaboration with travel agencies and addressing high no-deposit policies could reduce cancellations. Additionally, enhancing car parking availability and focusing on reducing waiting days can improve profitability and guest retention."
